"# Proj1_Eth-Avax" 
This is the first project for the Eth + Avax Course.
In this project, the goal is to create a smart contract that implements require, revert, and assert statements.
The setValue function allows the user to set a new value for inputValue. This function demonstrates the use of the required statements.
